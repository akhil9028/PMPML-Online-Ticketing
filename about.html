        <p>
          PMPML takes pride in being the lifeline of one of the fastest-growing
          cities in India - Pune. While the cultural capital of Maharashtra
          boasts of an enriching heritage and an expanding horizon, PMPML takes
          you on a journey through her crossroads of a glorious past and glitzy
          modernity. Be it for education, employment or entrepreneurship
          endeavors, Pune has become a center of excellence. A regular influx of
          people from all over the country and even outside requires an
          efficient public transportation system. PMPML by providing access
          through transport for educational, cultural, markets, economic
          activities, etc. plays a pivotal role in the sustainable development
          of the city. As a public transport service provider, we have been able
          to connect every nook and corner of the city in the most ecologically
          sustainable manner, by deploying the best in technology, while also
          making traveling safe and economic for our commuters.

        <h2>The History of Wheels</h2>
        <p>
          Pune's transportation system has developed gradually over the years.
          In the early 1940s, tangas were the only mode of transport. It was
          Pune Nagarpalika that conceived the idea of coming up with a public
          transport service. The dream took shape when the RTO permitted and M|s
          Silver Jubilee Motors was assigned the task. Back then there were just
          4 routes with 20 buses plying across them. The fleet grew to 46 by
          1948.
